## Second Project - Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

This project was developed for the subject of _Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms_ in IST (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico).
There are two versions, one using Floyd-Warshall's Algorithm, and another one using Johnson's Algorithm for Sparse graphs (since I missed the part that said graphs were sparse the first time I read the problem).
